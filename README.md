# Project-Wallet

## The aim of the project was to test the Wallet web application. The application is available in a desktop version and for mobile devices.

## The application enables tracking and planning of personal finances by allowing the user to add income and expenses divided into categories, taking into account the date of income and expenditure. The application allows you to create expense statistics in individual months and years. Additionally, the application informs about currency exchange rates.

## Our test group consisted of nine people. As a tester, I conducted static tests of the application's technical documentation and created a defect report. I was responsible for preparing checklists, test cases, performing tests and reporting errors on the statistics page and application language changes.
